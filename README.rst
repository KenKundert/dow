It is a maxim of investing that the stock market is risky but if you leave your 
money in over the long run it reliably provides the excellent returns.  `Visual 
Capitalist 
<https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/historical-stock-market-returns>`_ pegs 
the rate of return at over 8% when averaged over 200 years.  Such returns allow 
investors to beat inflation and build a nest egg if they keep their money in the 
market for decades.  But they leave one question unanswered: what are the 
expected returns adjusted for inflation?  The first part of this document 
attempts to get a handle on that.  Then, from that perspective, an alternate 
investment that promises much higher returns is considered.

First, lets examine the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time.

Over the last two hundred years the growth rate has averaged about 3.6%, but 
notice that the slope seems to change right around 1930, the date of the Great 
Depression.  Before the depression the slope was lower and the after the 
depression the slope increases.  This occurred because of changes in policy at 
that time increased the amount of inflation in the money supply.

When most people want to know the amount of inflation, they look up the CPI or 
Consumer Price Index. However, this is not a suitable measure of inflation when 
discussing investments.  The CPI measures the grown in the prices of essentials 
that are needed by the average person in their daily life, things like the cost 
of food and clothing. What we are interested in is inflation in the price of 
assets, after all one invests in assets like houses or companies, not in 
essentials like bread or socks.  The inflation in assets can be much different 
than the inflation measured by the CPI.

The best way to compensate for inflation in assets is to normalize the price of 
the asset to the price of gold. Gold is an asset and it is used primarily as 
a long term store of value as a hedge against inflation.  It holds its value 
regardless of inflation.

As you can see the price of gold was relatively constant until the Great 
Depression, at which point it started to climb as the gold standard began to 
falter. With the dollar losing its anchor it begins to inflate in a substantial 
way.  I assume that the value of gold has remained relatively constant over time 
as it has for millennia and instead the increasing price of gold over time is 
due to the decrease in purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation.

Now, if the Dow is normalized to the price of gold we can see the true return of 
the Dow over the last 200 years:

Notice that the change is slope is gone, which supports the idea that it was due 
to inflation and that the effect of inflation can be removed by normalizing to 
the price of gold.  Now the true rate of return is determined to be 2%, which 
seems to be quite modest especially considering the risk and volatility of the 
market.  Also notice that after the Great Depression the volatility of the 
market has substantially increased.  The increase in volatility is directly due 
to the increased inflation as it is inflation that creates and aggravates 
business cycles.

Now it is important to remember that the Dow is not the market, it is just one 
segment of the market. It is convenient to use because it has been around for 
a long time. In recent years more of the growth of the market is to be found in 
other averages, such as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

Consider the S&P 500.

In this case the apparent return is 6.8%. However, when inflation is removed ...

    :width: 100%

the true return is found to be an even more modest 1.6%.

Finally, consider the Nasdaq.

.. image:: nasdaq_usd.svg
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Here the return in terms of dollars is found to be 10.2%.

With inflation removed, the true return is revealed to be 5%.

What this shows is that one must carefully consider inflation when looking at 
long-term expected returns in the market.  The true returns are considerably 
less that what are generally advertised, which of course is very important to 
understand when planning for the long term.  These returns also come with 
substantial volatility, which can be hugely problematic. Imagine investing 
a substantial amount of money into the S&P 500 in 1927 for a planned retirement 
in 1980 only to find that after 50 years it only has one fifth the value in real 
terms of what you originally invested.


Bitcoin
-------

We currently have a remarkable alternative to investing in the stock market: 
bitcoin.  To understand bitcoin it important to understand that the value of 
almost all assets is based on their scarcity.  This did not used to be true with 
corporate equities. Many years ago the holders of equities were rewarded with 
dividends, meaning that it was worthwhile to hold the stocks even if the price 
of the stock did not change. But over time things changed and now the rewards 
from holding stock usually come from price appreciation rather than from 
dividends.  For the price of stock to appreciate, the shares must be scarce. The 
fewer the shares, the larger the fraction of ownership of the company that each 
share represents.  Indeed, the current run up of the stock market is due at 
least in part to stock buy backs. Buy backs increase the scarcity of the shares, 
increasing their value.  Conversely, companies can issue new shares, which tends 
to reduce the value of all shares.

All assets combine value with scarcity. I mention this because many people 
question bitcoin's validity as an asset.  But bitcoin provides tremendous value 
and is the only asset available whose supply cannot be intentionally inflated, 
as such its scarcity is guaranteed.  At this point the importance of its value 
is not widely recognized.  As such, it represents an investment opportunity.  As 
the importance of bitcoin becomes more widely recognized, its price will 
increase.

Briefly, the value of bitcoin is that it offers an efficient means of 
transferring money over the internet and is controlled by a decentralized 
network with a transparent set of rules, thus presenting an alternative to 
central bank controlled fiat money. The decentralized nature of bitcoin is its 
most unique and important feature.  It makes it difficult if not impossible for 
governments and banks to interfere with individuals use of their money. In 
addition, bitcoin has guaranteed scarcity. No one can decide to issue more 
bitcoin in the future, thus unlike fiat currencies, bitcoin is not subject to 
devaluation due to an inflating supply.  For these reasons, bitcoin is superior 
money and is now competing on the open market with government mandated 
currencies that lose value over time.  In the last 50 years the US dollar has 
been losing roughly 5% of its value every year.  Once people begin to recognize 
that bitcoin is superior money and it is available to them, they will begin to 
switch. Since bitcoin is scarce, as the switch occurs bitcoin increases in 
value, and that encourages more to switch.  This positive feedback suggests that 
once a threshold is reached, the transition to bitcoin will be swift, which will 
result in a rapid and dramatic increase in the value of each bitcoin.  This 
positive feedback is part of the network effect and common to many of the hugely 
valuable monopolies that currently exist, such as Google, Facebook, etc.  Those 
that own bitcoin and hold it through the transition can expect to benefit 
handsomely, just like the insiders that were able to get into Google and 
Facebook early.

To understand the potential of bitcoin, realize that 21M is the maximum number 
of bitcoin that will ever exists.  Currently (September 2020) there are 18.5M.  
I will approximate both of these numbers as 20M.  The current price is $11k, 
meaning that the total value of all bitcoin is roughly $220G. Estimates for the 
total amount of dollars in the world economy is very roughly $200T. Thus, for 
bitcoin to replace the dollar the total number of bitcoin must represent that 
$200T, meaning that in doing so each bitcoin eventually becomes worth $10M.
This represents a 1000× increase. To get the same return by investing in the 5% 
growth rate of the Nasdaq would require 140 years. 

If you look at the investment alternatives to bitcoin, you find things like 
stock, real estate, and gold.  However, all the alternatives that you know about 
today have already run up in value. For example, consider Apple. The total value 
of Apple stock is $2T. A great company, but just how much greater can it become?  
To exhibit a 1000× increase, it would have to become substantially larger than 
the entire world's economy.  Apple has been a great stock to own in the past, 
but now its growth is limited; it is near the end of its range.  What is unusual 
about bitcoin is that it is at the beginning of its range. It is relatively 
small at the moment but has a vast $200T total available market.  It also 
benefits from the network effect, which causes it both to grow quickly and repel 
competitors.  Bitcoin currently represents an unprecedented opportunity for 
those that seize the moment.

My advice to everyone is that they should get one and hold on. A single bitcoin 
currently represents a modest investment of $11k.  But if bitcoin does replace 
the dollar, that small investment could provide enough money to secure your 
future.  Get one for you, one for your spouse, and one for each of your kids to 
secure all their futures.
